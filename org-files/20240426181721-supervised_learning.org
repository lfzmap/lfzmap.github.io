A Supervised learning model defines a mapping from input $\overrightarrow{x}$ to output $\overrightarrow{y}$. This model represents a family
possible relationships between them while the parameters $\phi$ of model specify one of this relationship.
Hence we can represent a supervised learning model as follows:

\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{y} = f [\phi,\overrightarrow{x}]
\end{equation}

Training or learning aims to find the right $\phi$. Specifically it runs on a /training dataset/, $I = \{x_i,y_i\}$, computes a *Loss Function* $L [\phi]$ and
tries to find a $\phi$ such that the loss is minimum as possible.

\begin{equation}
\hat{\phi} = \mathop{\arg \min}\limits_{\phi}[L[\phi]]
\end{equation}
