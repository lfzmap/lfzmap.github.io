- *babel.config.js* : handle how code is transpiled
- *app.json* : configure some settings and behaviour of the app
- *App.js* : main component

* Basics
** Components
Defined as functions and returns react native jsx, so div or h1.
*** Core components
- View
- Text
- Image
- ScrollView
- TextInput
View is like a container with many children. You need to import components specifically.
** Styling
There is no styling language like css, but rather its done through inline styles and stylesheet objects in javascript. This is based on css syntax,
so a subset of css features are implemented.

#+begin_src
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
style1: {paddin:2}, style2: {borderColor: 'red'}
})
#+end_src

Layouts are typically created using flexbox. Main axis = y direction and Cross axis = x axis.
