* Configuration Space
** Intro
*** Links & Joints
*A robot is a set of *Links* connected with *Joints*.
*** Actuator
*Actuator* deliver force & torque to the links.
*** *End effector
End effector* manipulate or grasp objects. Attached to a specific link
*** Configuration
Set of all points on a robot.
*** Degrees of freedom (dof)
Minimum number of *real valued* points required to represent the configuration.

A coin has dof of 3 => x,y,angle. There can be a fourth variable for {head, tail}. Since it is not continous dof is still 3.
*** Configuration space (C-space)
The n-dimensional space containing all possible configurations of a robot.
*** Task space
C-space of end effector.
** Degrees of freedom of a rigid body
degrees of freedom = (sum of freedoms of the points) − (number of independent constraints)
  = (number of variables) − (number of independent equations)
- Dof of rigid body in 3d space = 6, in 2d = 3
- degrees of freedom = (sum of freedoms of the bodies) − (number of independent constraints)
** Degrees of freedom of a robot
Joints impose constraints.

*** Grubler's Formula
Consider a system of $N$ links (ground is also a link) with $J$ joints. Let $m$ be dof of rigid body (m=2 for planar and 6 for spatial). $f_{i}$ be dof of ith joint, $c_i$ be no of constraints.

$dof = rigid body freedoms - joint constraints$
$dof = m(N-1) - \sum_{i=1}^{J}c_i$

w.k.t $f_i = m - c_i$
$dof = m(N-1)-\sum_{i=1}^J{(m-f_i)}$

**** $dof = m(N-J-1)+\sum_{i=1}^J{f_i}$

*** Types of mechanism
**** Open-chain
Also known serial mechanism
**** Closed-chain
